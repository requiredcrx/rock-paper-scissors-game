# Rock, Paper, Scissors
A simple command-line based Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python for fun. This is my day 4 project in my 100 days of Python coding challenge.

## Rules
+ The game is played between two players (you and the computer)
+ Each round, a player chooses one of rock, paper, or scissors
+ Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock
+ If both players choose the same option, the round is a tie.

## Requirements
* Python 3
* No external library needed.

## How to play
To play the game, clone this repository and run the ```rps.py``` script :

## Copy code
```
git clone https://github.com/username/rps.git
cd rps
python rps.py
```
The game will guide you through the steps and you can play as much as you want.
Or you can play a live version of the game on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/@labelisaiah/rock-paper-scissors-game?v=1)

## How it works
The game will prompt you to choose between rock, paper, or scissors. It will then randomly generate the computer's choice and determine the winner of the round based on the rules outlined above. The game will continue until you choose to quit.
